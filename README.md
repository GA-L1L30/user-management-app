Project Overview

->This project successfully tackles all core requirements and many bonus features of the challenge. I've focused on building a robust application with a clean architecture and leveraging modern Angular features, including Signals, for optimal performance and reactivity.


Key Features & Implementations

Core Functionality

->User Management: The application provides a comprehensive interface for managing users, fulfilling the primary objective of the challenge.


Advanced UI & Component Architecture

->I've gone beyond the basic requirements to deliver a polished and user-friendly experience:

->Elaborate UI Design: The application boasts a highly detailed and professional user interface, reminiscent of a real-world social or professional networking platform. 

This includes:

->A dedicated side-information panel (side-info.component.ts) for supplementary content.

->Custom-styled cards (background-card.component.ts) to enhance visual presentation.

->Informative header cards (sub-header-info-cards.component.ts) for key insights.

->Advanced Component Structure: The project adheres to best practices for maintainability and scalability by breaking down the application into many small, highly reusable components (e.g., navbar, spinner, footer-paginator).


Enhanced User Experience & Utilities

To further improve the application, I've incorporated several features not explicitly requested:

->Local Storage for State Persistence: The home-page.component.ts intelligently uses localStorage to persist the selected user. This enhances the user experience by remembering their last selection across page reloads.

->Custom Pipes: I've developed custom Angular pipes, including capitalize.pipe.ts and compact-number.pipe.ts, demonstrating a thorough understanding of Angular's pipe system for data transformation.

->GoBack() event on (user-detail.component.ts) to nagivate to list again.
